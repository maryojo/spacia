## Overview

### The challenge

Create the UI design and the website should operate as required: 
- View the optimal layout for each of the website's pages depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- View each page and be able to toggle between the tabs to see new information

  console.log('ðŸŽ‰')
}
```
